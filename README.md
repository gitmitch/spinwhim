# SpinWhim.com Source Code

This is the source code for <http://spinwhim.com>

It is currently a static HTML site. It was originally created as a node.js app, but I never ran into a need for any server-side business logic, so I converted to a static HTML site. The node.js stuff is still in the repo in case I ever want to migrate it back to a node.js app.

I am using bower to install stuff, and everything necessary is in the bower.json.
